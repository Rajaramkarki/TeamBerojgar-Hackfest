# KU Hackfest 2023 - Federated Learning Project

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the KU Hackfest 2023 Federated Learning project. In this repository, we explore the fascinating world of Federated Learning by applying it to cardio-related CSV data. This project is designed to showcase the power of machine learning in a collaborative, decentralized manner.

## About the Project

Federated Learning is an emerging approach to training machine learning models across decentralized edge devices while keeping data local. This project focuses on applying Federated Learning techniques to cardio-related CSV data. We aim to develop a model that can predict cardiovascular health without centralizing sensitive medical information.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- [Virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) (optional but recommended).
